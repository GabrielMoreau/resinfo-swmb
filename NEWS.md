## Version 3.17 (2024/10/01)

The [SWLN](./dists/swln/) template is more generic (LEGI now uses the same files without any changes)
and it now supports the file with the `-Host-HOSTNAME` extension
in order to push a different file (e.g. specific tweaks) to a particular computer.
Each site can add its own pre and post-installation scripts.

Tweaks have a better message at launch, clearly indicating the type of tweak they are
(Enable, Disable, Set, Unistall...).

Correction of a gross error when launching a checkpoint (calling a function with the wrong name!).
The hash function has also been updated to take into account the UBR (Revision) version of the OS
(a number that changes regularly following the big monthly update).

The `wisemoui.ps1` graphical interface has been updated.
OS version is now shown in color.

The Target Release tweak must take into account the Windows version.
Windows 10 and Windows 11 do not have synchronized version names.
In the `Custom-VarOverload.psm1` variable file, there's now a `windows10` (or `windows11`) sub-key to define the Target Release associated with the correct system.
This naming process will be generalized in the future if there is a need to dissociate parameters according to OS.
However, it should be used as little as possible, to keep workstation administration as homogeneous as possible.

```ps1
# Target Release
$Global:SWMB_Custom.Windows10.ProductVersion           = 'Windows 10'
$Global:SWMB_Custom.Windows10.TargetReleaseVersionInfo = '22H2'
$Global:SWMB_Custom.Windows11.ProductVersion           = 'Windows 11'
$Global:SWMB_Custom.Windows11.TargetReleaseVersionInfo = '23H2'
```

* 2024/04/09 - `DisableUpgradesOnUnsupportedHard`/`EnableUpgradesOnUnsupportedHard`/`ViewUpgradesOnUnsupportedHard` -> Force a registry key so that hardware not supported for accepting Windows 11 upgrades can continue to benefit from updates (use at your own risk).


## Version 3.16 (2024/04/09)

This version offers specific initial support for Windows11.
Indeed, initial tweaks have been written and made default to limit searches and data leaks for Windows 11.
Tweaks can be deployed on Windows 11 and Windows 10 without disruption to the latter.

Continuous integration package creation now increments the version counter for each commit.
SWMB installation no longer generates a unique GUID by default (better GDPR compliant),
just put the EnableSWMBUniqueId tweak in a preset file, for example `LocalMachine-Boot.preset` and/or `LocalMachine-PostInstall.preset`,
so that each computer has a unique `HostId` on your park.

The `wisemoui.ps1` graphical interface has been updated.
The unique HostId is displayed if it exists.
Add a link to the project web page when the version is too old.

The SWLN template is more generic and its main files do not need to be modified.
SWLN defaults to the latest available version of SWMB.

Add link to the [Harden Community](https://hardenad.net/) in [REFERENCES](REFERENCES.md).

Most of the tweaks marked with the Windows11 tag are also available on Windows10,
but were not deactivated (or activated) at the time, because they were unknown!

Remove modules (move code to other modules):

* `Modules/SWMB/Resinfo.psm1` - dispatch tweaks in other module
* `Modules/SWMB/BSI.psm1` - dispatch tweaks in other module
* `Modules/SWMB/Contrib.psm1` - dispatch tweaks in other module

  `DisableUWPAccountInfo`, `DisableUWPDiagInfo`, `DisableUWPAccessLocation`, `DisableWindowsCopilot`

Update default `CurrentUser-All` preset:

* Activate `DisableWebSearch_CU`, `DisableFeedback_CU`

Two tweaks (`OneDriveSync` and `WindowsStoreAccess`) have been renamed in order to have uniqueness in tweak names,
whether they start with `Enable/Disable`, `Install/Uninstall`, `Show/Hide`...
The `check-project` script has been updated to check that this tweak uniqueness property is respected.

New presets/rules:

* 2024/03/05 - `UninstallAnyDesk`/`ViewAnyDesk` -> Uninstall AnyDesk remote desktop application

## Version 3.15 (2023/11/02)

SWMB can also be used to block the installation of certain software on
computers. The tested solution consists in making tweaks that silently
remove these programs, for example at each startup via the scheduled task.

It is then enough to put in its preset list, rather towards the end, a
list of tweaks corresponding to the software that you do not want to see
on your park. To give an example, why have WinRAR when the 7-Zip software
exists ? The UninstallWinRAR tweak removes any instance installed on the
computer.

The aim is not to turn SWMB into a fleet management software, but to
emphasize its security role by listing some software that should not be
installed on your computer.

The `wisemoui.ps1` graphical interface has been updated.
Now you can launch all tasks manually (`Boot`, `Post-Install` and `Logon`)
and a panel has been added to list all software installed on your computer (`HKLM`, `HKU` and `HKCU`).
Computer uptime has been added to the title bar.

During installation, SWMB writes a unique GUID to the registry
so that it can be used later in webhook calls to always have the same identifier for a computer.

New presets/rules:

* 2022/07/06 - `UninstallWinRAR` -> Remove WinRAR software if installed
* 2022/07/06 - `UninstallRealPlayer` -> Remove RealPlayer software if installed

Change to global parameter:

* SWMB_Custom.LocalAdminNameEffective replace SWMB_Custom.LocalAdminNameToSet

The new module `LocalMachine-Uninstall.psm1` is dedicated to all software
that need to be uninstall on a Windows park, with no rules to install them.
So they are one way rules only !

A new PostInstall task has been defined.
It starts shortly after SWMB installation if and only if there is a
`LocalMachine-PostInstall.preset` file in the `C:\ProgramData\SWMB\Presets` folder.
There is no default preset file in the SWMB distribution.
So for this to work, you have to put this preset file before the installation.
The purpose of this new task is to be able to push presets immediately,
without waiting for a possible reboot which can take place a long time later.

The tasks import by default the PowerShell module having the same name as the preset,
but having the extension `.psm1` and located in the folder `C:\ProgramData\Modules`.
If this module does not exist, but there is a module in this same folder
with the name `Local-Addon.psm1`, then this one is loaded instead.
This mechanism allows to have one common module for all tasks,
or to specialize a module for a task.
Since 2023/04/28, Schedule tasks now always import the `Local-Addon.psm1` module, if exists,
before the module specific to the task.

Thus it is not necessary to load a module at the beginning of a preset file
(`$IMPORT`) if we follow this naming convention.
The goal is to simplify the use and configuration of SWMB
to your machine environment.

If a module with the name `Local-Addon-Host-$(HOSTNAME).psm1` (hostname in lower case) exists,
it is also loaded, after the other modules.
We don't define the **host module** per task, because too much is too much.
We have to be simple in the end. One module for all tasks specific to one machine is enough.
An **host preset** is now also loaded.
If a hostname preset `LocalMachine-PostInstall-Host-$(HOSTNAME).preset` exists,
it is loaded after the **site preset**.
You can have a global preset for all computers
and some computers can have more or less preset (the preset can be deleted with the symbol !)
if a specific preset has been defined.
The host module and host preset are active for Logon, Boot and PostInstall scheduling tasks.

The **Host naming system** is extended to the `Overload` and `Autodel` modules.
Thus, when the `-VarOverload` and `-VarAutodel` modules are searched,
the associated `-VarOverload-Host-$(HOSTNAME)` and `-VarAutodel-Host-$(HOSTNAME)` modules are also searched.

With the **host module** and **host presets**, you can **deploy the same configuration** (set of files) to your fleet of computers
and **have some specific rules** for some computers.

In [dists](dists/) folder, a template [SWLN](dists/swln/) have been defined.
[SWLN](dists/swln/) is SWMB for your Local Network.
This template help you to create a Zip archive to deploy SWMB
with your configuration on your computer park with OCS, WAPT, PDQ Deploy, etc.

In [dists](dists/) folder, a very simple [webhook server](dists/webhook)
have been defined. The objective is to implement a webhook client inside
SWMB.


## Version 3.14 (2022/07/07)

The string `Tweak` has been added in front of the name of all tweak functions.
This means that preset files can no longer call standard Powershell functions.
If needed, a specific tweak function must be written for security reasons.

New presets/rules:

* 2022/06/01 - `DisableMSDT`/`EnableMSDT`/`ViewMSDT` -> Disable MSDT - Microsoft Support Diagnostic Tool Vulnerability - CVE-2022-30190
* 2022/05/09 - `ViewKasperskyProduct` -> View all the Kaspersky product
* 2022/05/09 - `UninstallKasperskyConsole` -> Remove the Kaspersky Console
* 2022/03/16 - `UninstallKasperskyEndpoint` ([see more](dists/uninstall-kaspersky/)) - use Custom configuration module
* 2022/03/16 - `SetTargetRelease`/`UnsetTargetRelease` -> For fix the target Feature Update version ([see more](https://admx.help/?Category=Windows_10_2016&Policy=Microsoft.Policies.WindowsUpdate::TargetReleaseVersion))
* 2022/03/02 - `EnableClearPageFile`/`DisableClearPageFile` -> Clean PAGEFILE.SYS at shutdown
* 2022/02/02 - `EnableASLR`/`DisableASLR` -> Address Space Layout Randomisation

There is now a special distribution of SWMB to just uninstall Kaspersky antivirus.
See [Uninstall Kaspersky](dists/uninstall-kaspersky/).

The overload modules for the configuration `*-varOverload.psm1`,
e.g. `Custom-varOverload.psm1` are now searched in the current folder,
then in the `ProgramData` folder and then in the installation folder.
For these three cases, we start with the current folder,
the subfolder `Modules` and then we go back up to the root of the file system.

* `(Get-Location).Path`  # `$PWD`
* `${Env:ProgramData}\SWMB`
* Module Script Path  # `${Env:ProgramFiles}\SWMB\Modules\SWMB`

The `Custom.psm1` module is now loaded by default.
The `SWMB_ImportModuleParameter` function has been moved from `SWMB.psm1`
to the Custom module (no other choice was found) and this module is loaded
first in the list of nested modules (see `SWMB.psd1`).
In case the `-core` option is used on the `swmb.ps1` command line,
you must load the Custom module in order for the `SWMB_ImportModuleParameter`
function to be used.

Many tweaks had not been classified in preset files.
This work on all the latest tweaks is already well underway.


## Version 3.13 (2021/11/22)

Add a setup file, juste write `make pkg` under Linux (Add a `Makefile`).
Continuous integration build the package
([here](https://resinfo-gt.pages.in2p3.fr/swmb/resinfo-swmb/)).
A Zip file is created for OCS Inventory.
A Zip file is also created for WAPT package.
You can use it as-is.

Add a minimal UI with `wisemoui.ps1` program. Launch it via the Start Menu.

Automatically search `Overload` and `Autodel` module in `C:\ProgramData\SWMB` folder
(and `Modules` subfolder).

Create two tasks:

* `CurrentUser-Logon.ps1` - Execute at user logon `C:\ProgramData\SWMB\Presets\CurrentUser-Logon.preset`
* `LocalMachine-Boot.ps` - Execute at boot `C:\ProgramData\SWMB\Presets\LocalMachine-Boot.preset`

If a module with the same name exist in `C:\ProgramData\SWMB\Modules`, it's will be launch.

An event is created in Application at begin and end.
Output is redirect in a log file inside the folder `C:\ProgramData\SWMB\Logs`.

Two presets `CurrentUser-Logon-Test.preset` and `LocalMachine-Boot-Test.preset`
are copied on folder `C:\ProgramData\SWMB\Presets`.
They could serve for test or as simple examples.

Two presets [CurrentUser-Logon-Recommanded.preset](Presets/CurrentUser-Logon-Recommanded.preset)
and [LocalMachine-Boot-Recommanded.preset](Presets/LocalMachine-Boot-Recommanded.preset)
are copied on folder `C:\ProgramData\SWMB\Presets`
with the names `CurrentUser-Logon.preset` and `LocalMachine-Boot.preset`.
They are execute at logon (account SYSTEM) and at boot (account CurrentUser).
Configuration tweaks are thus performed on any workstation that installs SWMB.
These tweaks are selected by the SWMB working group (RESINFO).
The default boot preset is not empty.
If you don't want any tweaks, replace these two files with empty ones
or don't activate them with the installer.
On the command line you can do this with:
```ps1
SWMB-Setup-XXX.exe /S /ACTIVATED_PRESET=0
```
Any value other than 0 (or nothing) will activate the default preset.

New presets/rules:

* 2021/10/21 - `$PRESET` and `$IMPORT` can open absolute and relative path file (before only relative path was possible)
* 2021/10/21 - `$PRESET` replace `$INCLUDE` to include a preset file.
* 2021/10/20 - `SysCheckpoint` - Make a system checkpoint if possible (max one per day)
* 2021/10/19 - `$INCLUDE` (`$PRESET`) and `$IMPORT` can open filename with space in PATH. Protect the string with double quote `"`.
* 2021/10/16 - `SysBox` - Like `SysMessage` but open a Box (experimental)
* 2021/10/15 - `SysEvent` - Like `SysMessage` but send an Event
* 2021/10/11 - `$IMPORT` - Like `$PRESET` but import a module from a preset file

New CLI parameter:

* `-import` replace `-include` to be more clear.
  As `$PRESET` replace `$INCLUDE` in preset file.
  The word `include` is not use anymore because sometime it was on modules and sometime on preset files.
* `-hash filename` makes a hash of the tweak list (preset)
  and compares it with the old hash stored in filename.
  If the hashes differ, a system checkpoint is performed.
  A folder `Caches` is created in `C:\ProgramData\SWMB`
  to store all the hashes.
* `-version` print the program version.

New module architecture, Win10- prefix has been replaced by LocalMachine-.
This is better for the new Windows 11 operating system.


## Version 3.12 (2021/09/14)

Rename main program Win10.ps1 to swmb.ps1
Add a compatibility program for upgrade Win10.ps1

New modules architecture:

* `Modules/SWMB.psd1` - Generic preload module (`Modules/SWMB.psm1`)
* `Modules/SWMB/Custom.psm1` - Additionnal rules with parameter
* `Modules/SWMB/Resinfo.psm1` - ANSSI rules
* `Modules/SWMB/Experimental.psm1` - Experimentals rules
* `Modules/SWMB/Win10-*.psm1` - Initial module from Disassembler0
* `Modules/SWMB/CurrentUser-*.psm1` - Initial module from Disassembler0 base on HKCU
* `Modules/SWMB/TemporaryBypass.psm1` - Temporary Bypass Strategy Module

Parameter module now use global hash table (via the `*-VarOverload.psm1` plugin).
Automatically search `Overload` variable module in parent folder.
Added support for the `Autodel` plugin in addition to the `Overload` plugin.
As the name suggests, the plug-in file `*-VarAutodel.psm1` will be deleted right after loading.

Add `View*` function to help debugging

New dists:

* [crypt-with-bitlocker](./dists/crypt-with-bitlocker/)

New CLI parameter:

* `-core`  - Load minimal SWMB code module. Must be the first parameter
* `-check` - Check for duplicated tweak preset and tweak implementations. Do not execute any preset
* `-exp`  - Load Experimental module (add Experimental feature)

New preset selection:

* `Post-Install.preset` - Enable Bitlocker after installation
* `Current-User.preset` - Preset for Current User and not Local Machine
* `System-Resinfo.preset` - Preset on system and network
* `LocalMachine-*.preset` - Rename `*-Resinfo.preset` file for local machine tweak
* `LocalMachine-Default.preset` - New global preset file with $INCLUDE directive
