# Secure Windows Compliance Enforcement

SWCE stands for Secure Windows Compliance Enforcement.
It is a tool from the SWMB galaxy.

SWCE is a tool that allows you to check the compliance of a workstation with a number of rules.
The rules are not enforced.
An assessment is carried out to identify what needs to be remedied in order to achieve compliance.

There is therefore no risk in running the tool on a workstation.
It is a PowerShell script (`swce.ps1`).
The lines of code are extracted from SWMB modules.
These are only read-only functions on the system.
